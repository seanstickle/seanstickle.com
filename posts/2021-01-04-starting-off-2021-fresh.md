It's been two years since I decided to launch what I informally refer to as "Stickle Corp". And I'm finally taking the next steps. Launching this website is one of the first.

The impact of applying Goldratt's Theory of Constraints, the strategic techniques of Wardley Mapping, Paul Akers' 2 Second Lean, David Marquet's Intent-Based Leadership, and other "tools of thought" will be HUGE in the nonprofit world. But most nonprofits take advantage of NONE of these. There is so much room for improvement across the sector.

Gary Vaynerchuk advocates: "Document. Don't create." That's what this blog is all about. I'm going to share with y'all what I'm working on, what I'm thinking, and the step-by-step development of products and services that I think might be useful. The blog is an behind-the-scenes look at building a new kind of nonprofit technology management operation.
