I've worked in nonprofit technology since 1999, from anti-poverty think tanks to higher education associations to teacher certification to solar power advocacy. These days, I work at the [National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)](https://nami.org).

Over the years, I've learned a lot about how nonprofits work (...and how they don't work) &mdash; both in terms of technology AND technology leadership.

My goal is to share what I've learned, so that we can continue improve nonprofits & associations in years to come.
